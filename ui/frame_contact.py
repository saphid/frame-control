"""An email address the person chooses to leave, and what it may be used for. Python stdlib only.

Two separate opt-in choices, both off until ticked:

- updates: occasional notices about Frame Control releases and updates
- followup: the maintainer may ask follow-up questions, mainly about problem reports

The address and the choices are kept on this computer (frame_host.data_dir('contact')) and
sent privately to Frame Control's PostHog project as a `contact_consent` event, the same way
as problem reports (frame_report.py), so only the maintainer can read them. Every change
sends a new event under this copy's own random contact id (not the analytics id), numbered
by `rev`, and the highest rev for an id is the one that counts, whatever the clocks say:
removing the address sends a withdrawal with no address in it, and wipes the address from
the local log of what was sent. The maintainer lists who agreed to what with
`python3 ui/frame_report.py contacts`. Nothing here sends email.

A change that can't be sent (offline) waits in the state file and is retried in the
background, so a withdrawal is never lost. The page's one-time prompt is remembered here
too: once it has been shown or dismissed it never comes back.
