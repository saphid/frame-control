"""Report a problem from inside Frame Control. Python stdlib only.

The page's Report a problem dialog shows the diagnostics below before anything
is sent, then this sends the report privately to Frame Control's PostHog
project as a `problem_report` event: only the maintainer can read it, and
nothing is published. It is sent whatever the analytics settings are, because
the person sends it deliberately. Diagnostics are scrubbed first
(frame_telemetry.scrub); the person's own words are sent as written.

An email address goes with a report only when the person ticks "may contact me with
follow-up questions" (contact_followup). Standing choices made in Settings are
frame_contact.py's `contact_consent` events; `contacts` lists them.
