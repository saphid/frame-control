"""The connection to the active headset: which address to use, and every step of getting there.

A background thread (Link) keeps one SSH connection to the active headset open
and publishes what it's doing, stage by stage, for the page's connection pill:

  1. network   checking this computer's network (gateway, Wi-Fi, Tailscale)
  2. find      finding the headset: every address probed on port 22 at once
  3. ssh       opening SSH to the address that answered
  4. identity  checking the headset's identity (its pinned host key)
  5. login     logging in as the device's user
  then connected (network, address, round trip), or failed at a stage with a
  plain reason and a countdown to the next try.

Addresses go in the order frame_devices.order_addresses gives. All are probed
at once; the best-ranked one that answers wins, waiting a moment (PREFER) for a
better-ranked address that's still trying, happy-eyeballs style. If SSH to the
winner fails in a way another address could fix (a different device answered,
the link dropped), the next one that answered is tried.

The server hands in `apply(alias, host_opts)`, which points every ssh, scp and
rsync it runs at the alias with `-o HostName=<address>` and friends, so they all
follow. Where ssh can share one connection (not Windows), the master connection
lives here; it reconnects when it dies, when this computer changes networks, and
when the page asks.

Python stdlib only. Runs on this computer, never on the Frame.
