# Testing

Frame Control is tested in three layers, from fast and fake to slow and real.
A fourth, a SteamOS VM, may come later ([issue #6](https://github.com/saphid/steam-frame/issues/6)).

| Layer | Runs | Needs | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit tests (`tests/*.py`) | `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` | Nothing | Parsing, validation, request guards; SSH and HTTP are mocked |
| Fake Frame (`tests/e2e`) | `scripts/e2e.sh` | Linux with Docker | The real server and scripts against a container that behaves like a Frame |
| Headset smoke test | `scripts/frame-smoke.sh` | A Frame on the `frame` alias | Install, launch and remove on the real device, recorded with its BUILD_ID |
| [Windows test VM](#windows-test-vm) | `scripts/windows-vm.sh` | A Linux machine with KVM and Docker | The Windows build on a real Windows desktop, against a real Frame when needed |

## Unit tests

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

About 120 tests, a few seconds, on Python 3.9 and newer. GitHub Actions runs
them on macOS, Windows and Linux. They don't pick up `tests/e2e`.

## The fake Frame

`tests/fakeframe/` builds a container that stands in for the headset, and a
second one for the computer Frame Control runs on. `scripts/e2e.sh` builds
both, starts them with `docker compose`, runs `tests/e2e` in the host
container and takes everything down, exiting with the tests' status:

```sh
scripts/e2e.sh                                   # everything, about 2 minutes plus the first build
scripts/e2e.sh test_titles                       # one module
scripts/e2e.sh test_faults.Faults.test_disk_full # one test
FAKEFRAME_KEEP=1 scripts/e2e.sh                  # leave it running afterwards
```

It needs a Linux host with Docker and `docker compose`, and zsh. The images
are `fakeframe-frame` and `fakeframe-host`; the compose project, network and
volumes are `fakeframe-e2e*`. CI runs it on a native arm64 runner
(`ubuntu-24.04-arm`, the `e2e` job in `.github/workflows/checks.yml`).

The host container exists because OpenSSH reads `~/.ssh/config` from the
passwd home directory, not `$HOME`. There, `ssh frame` reaches the fake Frame
through the same `Host frame` block `ui/frame_connect.py` writes, the
repository is mounted read-only at `/repo`, and each test module starts the
real `ui/server.py` (Python 3.9) and talks to it over HTTP with the headers
its guards want.

### What's real and what's fake

| On the fake Frame | |
|---|---|
| Arch Linux (`archlinux:base`, or Valve's Holo Core aarch64 preview on arm64), user `steamos`, `/etc/os-release` with BUILD_ID 20260922.6101926 | Real OS, Frame's identity |
| `sshd` with key and password logins, `rsync`, `python3` | Real |
| Valve's steamos-devkit-service on port 32000 and its hooks, vendored unmodified in `tests/fakeframe/steamos-devkit-service` | Real; only its `dbus` import (for mDNS through systemd-resolved) is a stand-in that logs the registration |
| Valve's devkit-utils, copied over by Frame Control itself | Real |
| **fakesteam**: `~/.steam/steam.pid`, `steam.token` and the `steam.pipe` FIFO; answers `approve-ssh-key`, `create-shortcut`, `run-game`, `list-shortcuts` and `delete-shortcut` with the response files devkit-utils waits for; takes `steam://rungameid`, `install` and `store` URLs | Fake |
| DevTools on `127.0.0.1:8080` with a `SharedJSContext` target. The JavaScript Frame Control sends runs for real in Node against stand-in `SteamClient`, `appStore` and `downloadsStore` objects (`cef_shim.js`), so async functions, optional chaining and `Map`s behave as in Steam's CEF | The JS engine is real; the objects are fake |
| `steam`, `wpctl`, `flatpak`, `podman`, `nmcli`, `qdbus6`, `gamescopectl`, SteamOS's `steamos-enable-sshd` helper, and Lepton's launcher | Stubs that record their calls |
| Battery, charger and thermal zones under `/sys/class` | Files the supervisor writes. `/sys` is read-only in a container and Docker's AppArmor profile refuses writes under it, so each folder is a volume mounted twice: over `/sys/class/...` for `frame_status.py` to read, and under `/var/lib/fakeframe/sys` for the supervisor to write |
| `vrserver` and `plasmashell` | Renamed `sleep` processes, so the status page and the clipboard find them |

Every fake behaviour copied from the device has a comment citing the doc or
observation and the BUILD_ID it came from; anything not seen on a headset is
marked as a guess. The fake keeps its state in `/var/lib/fakeframe/state.json`
(shortcuts, devkit titles, compat tool mapping, launches, pairing requests,
Lepton instances, volume, Flatpaks, clipboard) and logs stub calls to
`calls.jsonl` beside it.

Native programs really run: a launched aarch64 title executes on an arm64
host, and an x86-64 one on x86-64 (the container shares the host's kernel).
Proton titles are recorded with the command Steam would run, not run.

### Fault switches

`fakeframe-ctl` works over SSH (`ssh frame fakeframe-ctl help`) and from the
host container (`FAKEFRAME_CTL=http://fakeframe:9999`), so a test can flip a
switch while SSH is down:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `pairing on\|off` | Steam's **Pair new host** screen open or not; off gives the device's 403 text |
| `answer approve\|deny\|timeout` | How the pairing prompt is answered |
| `steam on\|off` | Steam client running (pid file, pipe, DevTools) |
| `sleep on\|off` | Headset asleep: ports 22 and 32000 accept and never answer, so SSH times out |
| `sshd on\|off` | sshd stopped: new connections are refused, open ones stay |
| `devkit-service on\|off` | Port 32000 closed |
| `disk-full on\|off` | Fills the small (64 MB) filesystem on `~/devkit-game` |
| `runtime NAME installed\|missing` | Proton, the Steam Linux Runtimes, Lepton |
| `battery KEY=VALUE...` | e.g. `capacity=15 status=Discharging current_now=-900000` |
| `keys harness\|none`, `authorized-keys` | Set or read `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` |
| `reset`, `state`, `calls [TOOL]` | Start over; read the state and call log |

### What the fake can't show

- Rendering: the headset view, desktop capture content, live video, SteamVR,
  gamescope and panels. The capture stub returns a placeholder PNG.
- Proton and FEX: whether a Windows or x86-64 program actually runs.
- Android: there's no Android in the Lepton stand-in, so no ADB, display
  settings, probes or app crashes.
- The real Steam client's UI and anything it does that isn't modelled, and
  mDNS discovery.
- `sudo` and the power buttons, Tailscale, and the Windows and macOS sides of
  the app (the host container is Linux, so the `rsync` paths are tested and the
  `scp` fallback isn't).

## Headset smoke test

**Documented shared-device procedure:** before a test installs, launches or
stops an application, acquire `ssh frame 'mkdir /tmp/frame-test.lock'`. If it
fails, leave that lock alone and continue offline work. Only the thread that
acquired it releases it with `ssh frame 'rmdir /tmp/frame-test.lock'`, after
cleanup. Keep each device session to a few minutes.

Check battery capacity and charging state under `/sys/class/power_supply`
before and after; keep capacity above 20%. Stop only processes started by the
test, remove temporary installs and profiles, and restore the prior dashboard
state. Leave Steam and SteamVR running. Do not reboot or change global settings.
Record the build, actual interaction results, cleanup and any unworn-headset
limits alongside screenshots or logs. These are caller responsibilities; the
smoke script below does not acquire this shared lock itself.

```sh
scripts/frame-smoke.sh           # needs `ssh frame` to work without a password
scripts/frame-smoke.sh --pair    # also pairs a throwaway key: approve it in the headset
```

It checks `properties.json` and the status, then installs, launches and
removes three tiny titles built from bytes by `tests/smoke/tiny_programs.py`
(an ARM64 and an x86-64 static Linux program that sleep for ten seconds, and
an x86-64 `.exe` that exits at once). A launch passes only with fresh evidence:
the ARM64 program running, the `.exe` started (its process or Steam's log),
and the x86-64 program running or Steam logging that its runtime isn't
installed, which is what the Frame does today. Steam's log lines about each
title are kept.

Everything it installs is removed again, also after a failure: the titles and
their Steam shortcuts, a paired key, and `~/devkit-utils` if it wasn't there
before (if it was, it stays, synced to this checkout as Frame Control always
does). A cleanup that fails counts as a failed step. Results go to
`tests/smoke/results/<time>-<BUILD_ID>.json` (not committed) with a summary on
screen; it exits 0 when every step passed, 1 if one failed, 2 if the headset
isn't reachable.

`--pair` asks the devkit service to pair a new RSA key, which needs someone
in the headset to open **Settings → Developer → Pair new host** and approve
it; the key is checked and then taken out of `authorized_keys` again.

## When the device disagrees with the fake

The fake is only as good as what's been seen on a headset. When the smoke
test (or anyone) finds the Frame doing something else:

1. Record what the device did, with the date and BUILD_ID, in the doc that
   covers it (`docs/sideloading.md`, `docs/ssh.md` and so on).
2. Change the fake to match, with a comment citing that observation. The
   behaviours are in `tests/fakeframe/rootfs/usr/local/lib/fakeframe/`
   (`fakesteam.py` for Steam, `cef_shim.js` for DevTools, `init.py` for the
   switches, the stubs in `rootfs/usr/local/bin`).
3. Run `scripts/e2e.sh`. If the app is wrong, the tests now fail the way the
   device did; fix the app and add a unit test.

For example, on 2026-09-27 the smoke test found that Steam's `create-shortcut`
refuses ids with a hyphen (`missing/invalid arguments`), which the fake had
accepted. The fake now refuses them the same way, and Frame Control makes ids
Steam accepts.

## Windows test VM

The unit tests run on Windows in CI, but the app itself doesn't. Anything that
depends on the Windows desktop (Remote Desktop, the installer, the bundled
Python, file dialogs) needs a real Windows machine. This is a Windows 11 VM in a
[dockur/windows](https://github.com/dockur/windows) container on a Linux machine
with KVM, driven from the Mac with `scripts/windows-vm.sh`.

Setting it up, once, on the Linux machine:

- **Windows comes from Microsoft.** The container downloads the Windows 11
  image from Microsoft on first start. Windows runs unactivated, which is fine
  for testing. Don't use activation workarounds or third-party Windows images.
- **Publish its ports on loopback only.** Map `127.0.0.1:2222:22` (SSH),
  `127.0.0.1:8006:8006` (the web console) and, if you need it,
  `127.0.0.1:13389:3389`. The Mac reaches them through `ssh -J`. Use
  `restart: "no"` and `stop_grace_period: 2m` so it only runs when someone is
  testing, and a `docker stop` shuts Windows down cleanly.
- **Give it SSH on first sign-in.** The container runs `/oem/install.bat`
  once. Have it add the OpenSSH Server capability, start `sshd`, set PowerShell
  as its default shell, and put a dedicated public key (for example
  `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_winvm` on the Mac) in
  `C:\ProgramData\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys`.
- Give it 4 cores, 8 GB of memory and a 32 GB disk. That's enough for the app
  and the tests.

Using it, with `WINVM_HOST` set to the Linux machine's ssh alias:

```sh
scripts/windows-vm.sh up                        # start it and wait for SSH (1-2 minutes)
scripts/windows-vm.sh put Frame-Control-Setup-x64.exe
scripts/windows-vm.sh ps 'Start-Process "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\Frame-Control-Setup-x64.exe" /S -Wait'
scripts/windows-vm.sh shot screen.png            # what's on its screen
scripts/windows-vm.sh click 723 359              # screen pixels, as in the screenshot
scripts/windows-vm.sh keys s t e a m o s ret     # QEMU key names
scripts/windows-vm.sh down                       # shut Windows down
```

- **Clicks go through a scheduled task.** Commands over SSH run in a
  session with no desktop, so `click` and `scroll` write the position to a
  file, and a scheduled task running as the signed-in user replays it. The
  VM's screen must be signed in; it is after `up`. Clicks and scrolls sent at
  the same time run one after another. QEMU's own `mouse_move` is relative
  and drifts, so the script doesn't use it.
- **Screenshots may not show the pointer.** Check the result of a click (a
  menu that opens, a button that changes) rather than the pointer's position.
- **Windows' `ssh` waits for stdin.** The script closes it for every command.
  Do the same if you run `ssh` in the VM by hand.
- **Starting the app.** Run Frame Control in the signed-in session, not over
  SSH. Use its Start-menu shortcut via `click`, or a scheduled task like the
  one `click` uses.

**Testing against a real Frame.** The VM reaches the headset on the LAN like
any other computer. Run **Set Up Connection** in the VM's Frame Control once;
that makes the VM's keys. So the VM doesn't keep access between test runs,
afterwards take the lines it added out of the headset's
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`: the ones matching the VM's
`~/.ssh/id_ed25519_frame.pub` and, if pairing made one,
`~/.ssh/id_rsa_frame_devkit.pub`. Check that `ssh -o BatchMode=yes frame true`
in the VM now fails. Then, around each run:

```sh
scripts/windows-vm.sh frame-key add       # let the VM's key into the headset
# ... test ...
scripts/windows-vm.sh frame-key remove    # and take it out again
```

`add` appends the VM's key tagged `windows-vm-test`, unless the headset
already trusts that key through another line. `remove` deletes only the exact
line `add` wrote, so it doesn't undo what Set Up Connection did, and it leaves
the file alone if it can't rewrite it. Follow the shared-device
procedure in [Headset smoke test](#headset-smoke-test) before installing or
launching anything on the headset.

**Verified 2026-09-30:** Windows 11 Pro 25H2 (build 26200) against a Frame on
BUILD_ID 20260925.6191901. The script was used to install Frame Control 0.4.0,
connect it to the Frame and follow Remote Desktop through to the Frame's
desktop ([what it does](streaming.md#a-see-and-control-the-frame-from-the-mac)).
`frame-key` left `authorized_keys` byte-for-byte as it was.

## Owned media player

`tests/test_media.py` covers layout evidence and overrides, OU eye ordering,
hardware-decoder command construction, malformed splats, stereo parallax and
fake-Frame library/process ownership. `tests/e2e/test_media_transfer.py` checks the real
HTTP/SSH upload and library listing without pretending the fake renders VR.
Real decode timings and captured stereo output are recorded in
[vr-video.md](vr-video.md). Generated media only; no external player required.

**Verified 2026-09-28**, real Frame BUILD_ID 20260925.6191901: `~/.local`
and `~/.local/share` are `steamos:steamos`, mode 0755. The fake supervisor
sets those parent owners too; previously its root-created Steam manifests
left the parents root-owned and incorrectly prevented user runtime installs.

## Agent interfaces

`tests/test_agent.py` exercises MCP stdio, exact-action human approvals and the
assistant against an in-process HTTP endpoint with canned responses (no keys or
external calls). `tests/e2e/test_agents.py` runs the MCP/HTTP/SSH path against the
fake Frame for approved installs, clipboard and file transfer. Headset Chromium
rendering and real screenshots still need a device; see [agent evidence](agents.md#evidence-and-limits).

## Family and comfort

`tests/test_comfort.py` uses an injected clock, fake headset sensor readings and
actions, plus a Node fake of Steam's Home API. It covers warnings before Home,
late/suspended sessions, cancellation, failed actions, duplicate alerts, reboot
invalidation, per-zone thermal trips and shared on-headset state. The server
guards reject invalid session settings before SSH. See
[real-device evidence and limits](family-comfort.md#verification).

## Panel switcher

`tests/test_panels.py` supplies fake-Frame `vrcmd --overlays` output, checks
main-panel filtering (including hidden panels), revalidates closed panels before
focus, and drives the headset helper's real loopback HTTP server to test access
keys, Host/Origin guards, malformed requests, offline errors and Close. It runs
in the normal unit suite without OpenVR or a headset. The fixture format comes
from SteamVR 2.18.1, BUILD_ID `20260925.6191901`; it does not simulate rendering.

On the Frame, run `python3 -` over SSH with `ui/frame_panels.py` on stdin to
list panels. `--focus <key>` rechecks the list and requests focus. In Frame
Control, **Tools → Panel switcher → Open in headset** exercises installation,
Chromium rendering and the same helper through HTTP. Close the switcher after
testing. [The recorded device checks](panels.md#frame-controls-panel-switcher)
cover actual focus, HTTP guards and an OpenXR sample transition, and separately
identify the unverified Steam-game, spatial layout, reboot and laser behaviors.
